QA Recommendations â€“ PersonalNutrition.com

# 1. Test Process Improvement

- Shift-Left Testing: Encourage involving QA earlier in the design and development phase to catch UI/UX flaws early.
- Regression Suite Maintenance: Create and maintain a reusable regression test suite to validate new updates quickly.
- Regular Smoke Testing: Automate or manually run smoke tests after each deployment to ensure critical paths are working.

# 4. Automation (No in the repo but optional)

If automation is considered in the future, prioritize:
- Homepage load check
- Navigation menu validation
- Form submission with valid and invalid inputs
- Broken links detection
- Responsive design validation using tools like Percy or BrowserStack
Note: Application not stable unable to perform automation duw to URl issues and navigation breaking
